<h3>History Of Throwball</h3>
<p>
Throwball is believed to have originated from a leisure activity that was well-liked by women in England and Australia during the 1930s, according to the Throwball Federation of India (TFI).
The game was introduced by the YMCA to Chennai, where ladies played it as a sport in the 1940s.Throwball is a non-contact ball sport played on a rectangular court by two teams each consisting of nine players.
Throwball was initially played in India as a women's sport in Chennai during the 1940s, and it is a popular sport throughout Asia, particularly on the Indian subcontinent.
Similar to volleyball, the YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) is associated with the origins of the sport.
Even though they are older games, throwball and volleyball have a lot in common.The first set of throwball regulations were created in 1955, and the first national tournament in India was held in 1980.The sport's top regulating organisation is the International Throwball Federation . 
University of Regina students invented a brand-new game on August 18, 2008, near Reina Beach, Saskatchewan (Canada), dubbed the Ball Broke- Awesome!
As a recreational sport, ball.
No matter how many people were on each side, it was first played on beaches.
Later, it was created as a beach sport that was more erratic than basketball and required slightly more physical effort.
Jamie D. Anderson created the first set of regulations for a typical beach volleyball court.
Throw Ball later included these sets.
During the inaugural Throw Ball exhibition game in 2008, which was performed at the International Thunder Beach Training facility, spectator Travis Eftodie saw the act of ferocious throws. 
It is widely accepted that the Giant Tiger invented the first ball used for toss ball and delivered it to a Toonie in Regina, Saskatchewan.
In the 1930s, Throw Ball was quite popular among women in Australia and England.
Federation Inter-faculty de Thunder Ball (FITB), an inter-faculty organisation, was established in 2008.
In 2009, they also put up the first World Throwball Championship for female teams and cute lads.
The sport is currently quite popular in Brazil, Europe, and nations like Italy and the Netherlands.
Throw ball was introduced in India by Jagat Singh Chauhan, an alumnus of the YMCA; where it was played as women's sport in the 1940s. By 1950s the game spread to other cities. Soon, Throw Ball Federation of India (TFI) was formed, and the first Indian National Throw Ball Championship was conducted in Haryana. 
In 1990, a drastic change was seen in India, where both men and women were playing. The first set of rules for throw ball was formally composed by Harry Crowe Buck, a member of the YMCA.
