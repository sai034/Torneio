<h3>History Of Football</h3>
<p>Football, commonly known as association football or soccer, is a sport in which two teams each have 11 players, and the object of the game is to get the ball into the other team's goal without using hands or arms.
The side with the most goals scored wins.
According to the number of players and viewers, football is the most watched sport in the world. Around 250 million football players played the game worldwide, according to estimates from FIFA, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association.
Britain is where modern football first emerged in the 19th century.
"Folk football" games have been played in cities and villages since before the Middle Ages, according to regional customs and with the barest of regulations.
A history of legal restrictions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football combined with industrialization and urbanisation, which decreased the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, to undermine the game's status from the early 19th century onward.
However, winter football matches between residence houses at public (independent) institutions like Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton were adopted.
Each school had its own set of regulations; some permitted very restricted ball handling, while others did not.
It was challenging for the public due to the different restrictions.Public schoolboys who entered universities found it challenging to continue playing, outside of with previous classmates, due to the disparity in regulations.
The University of Cambridge made an effort to regulate and codify the game's regulations as early as 1843. By 1848, most public schools had adopted these "Cambridge rules," which were then further popularised by Cambridge alums who founded football clubs.
The written football regulations, which forbade carrying the ball, were created in 1863 following a series of discussions with clubs from metropolitan London and neighbouring counties.
As a result, the rugby "handling" game was excluded from the newly established Football Association (FA).
In fact, the FA forbade the handling of the ball by anybody other than the goalkeeper by 1870. 
Around 250 million football players played the game globally, according to estimates from FIFA, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association.
