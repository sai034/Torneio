<h3>History Of Tug Of War</h3>
<p>Strong archaeological evidence points to the game's inception in India as early as the 12th century AD in the region that is now the State of Orissa on the east coast.
On the west wing of the famed Sun Temple of Konark, a stone sculpture depicts a tug-of-war match in full motion.The beginning of tug of war cannot be located at a certain period or location.
The pulling-a-rope competition has its roots in ancient rites and cults that are still practised today in places like Egypt, Burma, India, Borneo, Japan, Korea, Hawaii, and South America.
There were several ways to execute the ancient tug of war.
Teams in Afghanistan pulled with a wooden stick rather than a rope.
Children in Korea would construct a living tug-of-war chain by around each other's waists with their arms.
The game of tug of war was not just for teams.
Man-to-man tug of war was played in a number of nations.
The tug-of-war competition known as "arsaaraq" is still held by the Canadian Eskimos.
Later, tug of war evolved into a pure test of strength.
Around 500 BC, athletes in Greece, the birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games, began playing tug of war either as a competitive activity or as a physical conditioning drill for other sports.
Evidence of tug of war may be discovered in Western Europe as early as the year 1000 AD, in the tales of the valiant champions of Scandinavia and Germany who took part in the so-called "kräftige spiele" (power games).
The tug-of-war game was played in the Chinese Emperors' courts as well as in Turkey and Mongolia.
The 15th Century tug of war was a well-liked competition at competitions in French chateaux and in the UK.
Sadly, tug of war was removed off the schedule in 1920 when the IOC (International Olympic Committee) decided to cut back on the number of athletes competing in the Olympic Games.
Again receiving provisional IOC accreditation in 1999, the Tug of War International Federation (TWIF), of which the Tug of War Association is a founding member, later acquired full IOC recognition in 2002 in compliance with Olympic Charter Rule 29.
The Tug of War International Federation (TWIF) is the recognised international governing organisation for the sport of tug of war, which is still recognised by the IOC. 
Thankfully, tug of war was still played in many nations, leading to the founding of national organisations. The first was Sweden in 1933, followed by The Tug of War Association of England in 1958, and shortly after, many other nations did the same.
The option to compete internationally had vanished once tug of war was removed from the Olympic Games' schedule.
The necessity for international competition emerged concurrently with the establishment of national tug of war groups.
George Hutton of The Tug of War Association of England decided to create an international federation in 1960.
The concept was made a reality in collaboration with officials from the Swedish group. 
The Baltic Games, which were held in Malmö, Sweden, hosted the first international tournament.
The Tug of War International Federation (TWIF) competed with four nations: Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Great Britain (represented by Wood Treatment Bosley from Cheshire).
TWIF organised its inaugural European championships in Crystal Palace, London, in 1965 following the first international tournament at the Baltic Games.
From that point on, European Championships were held at regular intervals until 1975, when nations outside of Europe affiliated with TWIF, leading to the staging of the inaugural World Championships in the Netherlands.
World Championships are currently organised by TWIF every two years.
The following years see the organisation of the European Championships.

<h3>Rules Of Tug Of War</h3>
<p><pre>
<b>The goal of the game</b>
The majority of tug-of-war matches are best-of-three affairs, with the winner needing to prevail in at least two of the three pulls in order to defeat the opposition and claim victory.
The goal of each pull is to win by drawing the other team and their 4m marker toward the centre until the mark crosses the centre line, which results in a win.
In a tug of war contest, a tie is impossible. 
<b>Athletes and equipment
</b>
Eight people make up each tug of war team, and they all work together to pull the rope.
Although it appears to be a very straightforward sport, there is considerable technical skill involved since team members must use rhythm to pull the rope well.
This is accomplished with the aid of a "driver," who is not a team member but functions as a coach by giving instructions to the team from the sidelines on when to pull and when to relax.
The most crucial piece of gear is a rope, which has to be at least 33.5 metres long, 11 cm in circle, and have simple, whipping ends.
Participants may also make use of additional equipment, such as specialised 
Scoring
In Tug of War, there is no scoring as such like you may see in other team games such as American Football or Soccer. 
However, because teams are pitted against each other usually in a best of three match, there is a form of scoring, in that the winner of the match must win two out the three pulls to win the match.
