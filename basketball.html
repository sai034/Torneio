<h3><b> History Of Basketball</b></h3>
<p><u>The Place of Basketball's Origin</u>
The sport of basketball is ingrained in Springfield College's culture.
James Naismith, a graduate student and lecturer at Springfield College, created the sport in 1891, and it has since spread to become the well-known sports phenomenon that it is today. 
In order to keep young sportsmen in shape throughout the chilly months, Dr. James Naismith invented basketball as we know it today in Springfield, Massachusetts, in December 1891.
In Springfield, Massachusetts, at the YMCA International Training School, which is now Springfield College, Naismith taught physical education.
To assist sportsmen stay in shape over the winter, Naismith was urged by his supervisor to develop an indoor sport using peach baskets and a soccer-style ball.
13 rules for the new game were issued by him.
He formed two teams of nine players each out of his eighteen students and began instructing them in the fundamentals of his brand-new game. 
The goal of the game was to lob the basketball into the fruit baskets that were affixed to the gym balcony's lower railing.
The game was stopped every time a goal was made so the janitor could get a ladder and get the ball.
The fruit baskets' bottoms were eventually taken off.
Springfield, Massachusetts hosted the first basketball game ever on March 11, 1892.
On December 21, 1891, Naismith published the five fundamental concepts and thirteen regulations for a brand-new game. On that day, he requested his pupils to compete in a game of 9 vs 9 on the Armory Street court using a soccer ball and two peach baskets.
One of his classmates, Frank Mahan, wasn't too pleased.
A person suggested calling it the "Naismith Game," but he countered, "We have a ball and a basket: why don't we name it basketball?"  The eighteen participants were John G.  
Thompson, Eugene S. Libby, Edwin P. Ruggles, William R. Chase, T. Duncan Patton, Frank Mahan, Finlay G. MacDonald, William H. Davis, and Lyman Archibald won by a score of 1-0 over George Weller, Wilbert Carey, Ernest Hildner, Raymond Kaighn, Genzabaro Ishikawa, Benjamin S. French, Franklin Barnes, George Day, and Henry Gelan.  Chase scored the
Until a little hole was made in the bottom of the peach basket to allow the ball to be prodded out with a stick, the peach baskets were closed and balls had to be retrieved manually.
Metal hoops, nets, and backboards weren't adopted until 1906.
The soccer ball was replaced in 1894 by one that Naismith ordered from Spalding.
